       "'VISUALIZATION\\n1Interactive Dynamics for \\nVisual Analysis\\nA taxonomy of tools that support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations\\nJeffrey Heer,  Stanford University \\nBen Shneiderman, University of Maryland, College Park\\nThe increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing \\npublic policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain-specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. \\nVisualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to \\nvisual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.\\n11 A single image, however, typically \\nprovides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. \\nThe goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement \\nofficers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The taxonomy \\nData & View Specification Visualize  data by choosing visual encodings.\\nFilter  out data to focus on relevant items.\\nSort  item s to ex pose pa tterns.\\nDerive values or models from source data.\\nView Manipulation Select  item s to hi ghlight, filter, or man ipulate th em.\\nNavigate to examine high-level patterns and low-level detail.\\nCoordinate  views for linked, multi-dimensional exploration.\\nOrganize multiple windows and workspaces.\\nProcess & Provenance Record  analysis histories for revisitation, review and sharing.\\nAnnotate patterns to document findings.Share views and annotations to enable collaboration.Guide  users through analysis tasks or stories.TABLE 1:  Taxonomy of interactive dynamics for visual analysisVISUALIZATION\\n2consists of 12 task types grouped into three high-level categories, as shown in table 1: (1) data \\nand view speci fication (visualize, filter, sort, and derive); (2) view manipulation (select, navigate, \\ncoordinate, and organize); and (3) analysis process and provenance (record, annotate, share, and guide). These categories incorporate the critical tasks that enable iterative visual analysis, including visualization creation, interactive querying, multiview coordination, history , and collaboration. V alidating and evolving this taxonomy is a community project that proceeds through feedback, critique, and re finement. \\nOur focus on interactive elements presumes a basic familiarity with visualization design. The \\nmerits and frailties of bar charts, scatter plots, timelines, and node-link diagrams, and of the visual-encoding decisions that underlie such graphics, are certainly a central concern, but we will largely pass over them here. A number of articles and books address these topics in great detail,\\n11,12 ,16,52  and \\nwe recommend them to interested readers. \\nWithin each branch of the taxonomy presented here, we describe example systems that exhibit \\nuseful interaction techniques. T o be clear, these examples do not constitute an exhaustive survey; rather, each is intended to convey the nature and diversity of interactive operations. Throughout the article the term analyst  refers to someone who uses visual analysis tools and not to a speci fic person \\nor role. Our notion of analyst encompasses anyone seeking to understand data: traditional analysts investigating financial markets or terrorist networks, scientists uncovering new insights,\\njournalists piecing together a story , and people tracking various facets of their lives, including blood pressure, money spent, electricity used, or miles traveled. \\nDATA AND VIEW SPECIFICATION \\nT o enable analysts to explore large data sets involving varied data types (e.g., multivariate, geospatial, textual, temporal, networked), flexible visual analysis tools must provide appropriate controls for \\nspecifying the data and views of interest. These controls enable analysts to selectively visualize  the \\ndata, to filter  out unrelated information to focus on relevant items, and to sort information to expose \\npatterns. Analysts also need to derive  new data from the input data, such as normalized values, \\nstatistical summaries, and aggregates. \\nVISUALIZE \\nPerhaps the most fundamental operation in visual analysis is to specify a visualization of data: analysts must indicate which data is to be shown and how it should be depicted. Historically , this process required custom programming of a speci fic visualization component. Within user interfaces, \\nsuch visualization “widgets” are often presented in a chart typology , a palette of available visualization \\ntemplates (bar charts, scatter plots, map views, etc.) into which analysts can slot their data. This method of interaction will be immediately familiar to users of spreadsheet programs: users select a chart type and assign data variables to visual aspects such as the X/Y axes and the size or color of visualized marks. A chart typology has the bene fits of simplicity and familiarity , but it also limits the \\ntypes of possible visualizations and makes it cumbersome to try out different visualizations of the same data. \\nSome visualization system designers have explored alternative approaches. Classic scienti fic \\nvisualization systems\\n1 and more recent platforms for artistic expression9 use data-flow graphs , in \\nwhich the visualization process is deconstructed into a set of finer-grained operators for data \\nimport, transformation, layout, coloring, etc. Analysts interactively chain these operators together VISUALIZATION\\n3to construct novel displays. Through flexible combinations of operators, data- flow models can \\nenable a larger space of visualization designs. Data- flow systems require more input effort than chart \\ntypologies, however, and may be limited by the set of available operators. In many cases, novel \\ndesigns require analysts with programming expertise to develop new building blocks for the system. \\nOther systems are based on formal grammars for visualization construction. These grammars \\nconstitute high-level languages for succinctly describing how data should be mapped to visual features. By combining a handful of such statements, analysts can construct complex, customized visualizations with a high degree of design control. This approach is used by a number of popular data visualization frameworks such as Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics ,\\n57 ggplot2 for the \\nR statistical ana\\nlysis platform,56 and Protovis for HTML5.10 Each of these requires at least minimal \\nprogramming ability , however. \\nT ableau51 (née Polaris50) provides an example of visualization speci fication by drag-and-drop \\noperations: analy\\nsts place data variables on “shelves” corresponding to visual encodings such as \\nspatial position, size, shape, and color (see figure 1). The visual speci fication is then translated into \\nan underlying formal grammar that determines both the visualization design and corresponding queries to a database. This approach leverages the expressiveness of formal grammars while avoiding the need for programming. Another advantage is that formal grammars can be augmented with automated design facilities: a system can generate multiple visualization suggestions from a partial speci fication.\\n37,38,44 While systems based on formal grammars are both fluent and expressive, users \\nneed to understand the underlying generative model, which imposes a steeper learning curve than the more familiar chart typology . \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\nVisual encoding via drag-and-drop actions in Tableau51 VISUALIZATION\\n4Fortunately , these methods are not mutually exclusive. Analysts can apply a data- flow system \\nor formal grammar to de fine new components to include within a chart typology , leveraging \\nthe improved expressiveness of the former and the ease of use of the latter. Novel interfaces for \\nvisualization speci fication are still needed. A formal grammar that uses graphical marks (rectangles, \\nlines, plotting symbols, etc.) as its basic primitives provides a conceptual model compatible with interactive design tools. New tools requiring little to no programming might place custom visualization design in the hands of a broader audience. \\nFILTER \\nFiltering of data values is intrinsic to the visualization process, as analysts rarely visualize the entirety of a data set at once. Instead, they construct a variety of visualizations for selected data dimensions. Given an overview of selected dimensions, analysts then often want to shift their focus among different data subsets— for example, to examine different time slices or isolate speci fic \\ncategories of values. \\nDesigners have devised a variety of interaction techniques to limit the number of items  in \\na display . Analysts might directly select (e.g., “lasso”) item s in a display and then highlight \\nor exclude them; we discuss these forms of direct view manipulation later. Another option is to use a suite of auxiliary controls, or dynamic query widgets ,\\n47 for controlling item  visibility (see \\nfigures 2, 3, and 4). The choice of appropriate widget is largely determined by the underlying data \\ntype. Categorical or ordinal data can be filtered using simple radio buttons or checkboxes (when \\nthe number of distinct item s is small), or scrollable lists, hierarchies, and search boxes with \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\nSpotfi re Google Hotel SearchExamples of dynamic query filter widgetsVISUALIZATION\\n5autocomplete (when the number of distinct item s is large or contains arbitrary text). Ordinal, \\nquantitative, and temporal data can also be filtered using a standard slider (for a single threshold \\nvalue) or a range slider (for specifying multiple endpoints). When coupled with realtime updates \\nto the visualization, these widgets allow rapid and reversible exploration of data subsets. In figure \\n2, Spot fire (left) provides a variety of controls for filtering visualized data: checkboxes and radio \\nbuttons filter categorical variables, while range sliders filter numerical values; on the right, Google \\nHotel Search provides widgets for geographic, date, and price ranges. Query controls can be further augmented with visualizations of their own: figure 3 shows a range slider augmented with a \\nhistogram of underlying values. \\nExpert analysts also bene fit from more advanced functionality .

While these additional \\nmechanisms may not support rapid, incremental exploration as fluently as graphical widgets, they \\nprovide a means for expressing more nuanced criteria. Filtering also interacts with other operations: filtering widgets may operate over data sorted in a user-speci fied manner (see next section), or users \\nmight create derived values (see section after next) and filter based on the results. \\nSORT Ordering (or sorting) is another fundamental operation within a visualization. A proper ordering can effectively surface trends and clusters of values\\n5 or organize the data according to a familiar unit of \\nanalysis (days of the week, financial quarters, etc.). The most common method of ordering is to sort \\nrecords according to the value of one or more variables. Sorting controls can be simple choices in a toolbar or clicks on the header of a table to produce ascending or descending sorts for numerical or textual values. Sometimes specialized sort orders such as weekday or month names are necessary to reveal important patterns. \\nOrdering becomes more complicated in the case of multiple view displays, in which both entire \\nplots and the values they contain may be sorted to reveal patterns or anomalies. Sorting values consistently across plots (for example, by their marginal mean or median values) can reveal patterns while facilitating comparison among plots. \\nSome data types (e.g., multivariate tables, networks) do not always lend themselves to simple \\nsorting by value. Such data may require more sophisticated seriation  methods\\n20,57,58 that attempt \\nto minimize a distance measure among item s. The goal is to reveal underlying structure (e.g., \\nclustering) within the data. An example is shown in figure 5, a matrix-based visualization of a \\nsocial network. On the left, a matrix plot of a social network conveys little structure when the rows and columns (representing people) are sorted alphabetically . Interactively reordering the matrix by node degree reveals more structure (center). Seria ting the matrix by network connectivity reveals \\nunderlying clusters of communities (right).\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F Reorderable matrices\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F VISUALIZATION\\n7DERIVE \\nAs an analysis proceeds in iterative cycles, users may find that the input data is insuf ficient: variables \\nmay need to be transformed or new attributes derived from existing values. Common cases include normalization or log transforms to enable more effective value comparisons. Derived measures are often used to summarize the input data, ranging from descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance) to model fitting (regression curves) and data transformation (group-by aggregation such as counts or \\nsummations). While analysts can derive new values prior to importing data for visual analysis, the overhead of moving between tools stymies fluid, iterative exploration. As a result, visual analytics \\ntools should include facilities for deriving new data from input data. Often this functionality is provided via a calculation language , similar to those found in spreadsheets or database query \\nlanguages. Beyond these basic functions, hypothesis-testing methods (t-tests, ANOV A) can amplify the bene fits of smooth integration of statistics and visualization. \\nImproved derivation methods present a promising frontier for visual analytics research. How \\ncan visual tools support flexible construction of more advanced models or derived values? Using \\nprogramming-by-demonstration methods, analysts might annotate patterns (e.g., of network intrusion events\\n60) from which the system can generalize pattern-recognition rules. Or, visual tools \\nmight automatically fit applicable statistical models to the data based on the current visualization \\nstate. For example, the nesting of variables within common “pivot” displays could be mapped to the structure of a linear model. More principled frameworks that wed visualization to modeling and forecasting are still emerging. \\nVIEW MANIPULATION \\nOnce analysts have created a visualization through data and view speci fication actions, they should \\nbe able to manipulate the view to highlight patterns, investigate hypotheses, and drill down for more details. Analysts must be able to select  item s or data regions to highlight, filter , or operate \\non them. Large information spaces may require analysts to scroll, pan, zoom, and otherwise navigate \\nthe view to examine both high-level patterns and fine-grained details. Multiple, linked visualizations \\noften provide clearer insights into multidimensional data than do isolated views. Analysis tools must be able to coordinate  multiple views so that selection and filtering operations apply to all displays at \\nonce and organize  the resulting dashboards and work spaces. \\nSELECT Pointing to an item or region of interest is common in everyday communication because it indicates the subject of conversation and action. In the physical world, people coordinate their gestures, gaze, and speech to indicate salient item s. For example, different hand gestures can communicate \\nangle (oriented flat hand), height (horizontal flat hand), intervals (thumb and index finger in “C” \\nshape), groupings (circling a region), and forces (accelerating fist).\\n27 In visual analysis, reference (or \\nselection ) remains of critical importance, but it is realized through a more limited set of actions, such \\nas clicking or lassoing items of interest. \\nCommon forms of selection within visualizations include mouse hover, mouse click, region \\nselections (e.g., rectangular and elliptical regions, or free-form “lassos”), and area cursors (e.g., “brushes”\\n4 or dynamic selectors such as the bubble cursor,18 which selects the item  currently \\nclosest to the mouse pointer). VISUALIZATION\\n8These selections often determine a set of objects to be manipulated, enabling highlighting, \\nannotation, filtering, or details-on-demand. Note that interactive selection is closely related to \\nfiltering: selections can be used to identify items to remove from the display . The context of \\ninteraction must also be taken into account when choosing a selection method. For example, \\nresponding to hover events to provide details-on-demand is inappropriate when using touch-based input on a tablet or mobile phone. \\nSelections can also vary in terms of their expressive power. Most interfaces support selections of a \\ncollection of items. Though this approach is easy to implement, it does not allow analysts to specify higher-level criteria. A more powerful, albeit more complex, approach is to support selections as queries over the data.\\n22 Maintaining query structure increases the expressiveness of visualization \\napplications. For example, rather than directly selecting the contained item s, drawing a rectangle \\nin a chart may specify a range query over the data variables represented by the X and Y axes. The resulting selection criteria can then be saved and applied to dynamic data (updating item s may \\nenter or exit a query region) or to a completely different visualization. Examples include querying stock-price changes in TimeSearcher\\n28 (see figure 6) and attribute ranges in parallel coordinates \\ndisplays30 (figure 7). In figure 6 an angular selection tool speci fies a target slope (rate of change) and \\ntolerance for a collection of stock prices. All time series with a similar slope over the queried time range are selected; shaded regions show envelopes of minimum and maximum values. The widget operates directly on the visualization: dragging the widget from left to right interactively queries other time windows. In figure 7 parallel coordinates plot multidimensional data as line segments \\namong parallel axes. Here, an analyst has dragged along the axes to create interactive selections that highlight automobiles with low weight and high mileage. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F Querying time-series by slope in TimeSearcher28\\nVISUALIZATION\\n9Designing more expressive selection methods remains an active area of research. For example, \\nresearchers have proposed methods to map mouse gestures over a time-series visualization to \\nselect perceptually salient data regions such as peaks, valleys, and slopes35 (see figure 8) or to query \\ncomplex patterns of temporal variation.29 Initial selections can also be used as a starting point for \\nmore complex selections, as analysts might click a representative object and then formulate a broader selection based on the object’s properties (e.g., “select all items blue like this one”).\\n22 Of course, \\nselection need not be limited to the mouse and keyboard: input modalities such as touch, gesture, and speech might enable new , effective forms of selection. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\nSelection queries in parallel coordinates\\nPerceptual interpretation of Ink annotations35VISUALIZATION\\n10NAVIGATE \\nHow analysts navigate a visualization is in part determined by where they start. One common pattern of navigation adheres to the widely cited visual information-seeking mantra: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.”\\n48 Analysts may begin by taking a broad view of the \\ndata, including assessment of prominent clusters, outliers, and potential data-quality issues. These orienting actions can then be followed by more speci fic, detailed investigations of data subsets. A \\ncommon example is geographic maps: an overview might show an overall territory , followed by zooming into regions of interest. For example, the map in figure 4 depicts criminal activity by time \\nand region. It shows all crimes committed after dark during the last week of October 2011. Dynamic query widgets enable filtering by time of day (left), date span (bottom), and type of crime (right). Pan \\n(drag) and zoom (buttons and scroll wheel) controls enable view navigation. As an analyst zooms in on the map, the circular crime markers gain detailed labels— a form of semantic zooming .\\nOf course, starting with an expansive overview is not always advisable. A legal analyst researching \\nfor an upcoming trial may be wise to forego an overview of the entire history of U. S. court decisions. Instead, the analyst might start with the legal decisions most relevant to the current case, perhaps determined by keyword search, and expand the investigation to other, cited decisions. This form of navigation can be summarized as “Search, show context, expand on demand.”\\n53 \\nIn either case, visualizations often function as viewports  onto an information space. Analysts \\nneed to manipulate these viewports to navigate the space. Common examples include scrolling or panning a display via scrollbars or mouse drag, and zooming among different levels using a zoom slider or scroll wheel ( figure 4). Zooming need not follow a strict geometric metaphor: semantic \\nzooming\\n7 methods can modify both the amount of information shown and how it is displayed \\nas analysts move among levels of detail. In the calendar in figure 9, the display magni fies selected \\nregions as analysts navigate from months to days to hours. Semantic zooming reveals more details within focal regions. Additionally , dynamic query widgets, such as range sliders for the X and Y axes \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\nDateLens Focus-plus-Context Calendar6VISUALIZATION\\n11of a scatter plot, can filter the visible data range and thus provide a form of zooming within a chart. \\nT o aid navigation further, researchers have developed a variety of focus plus context  methods. These \\n“bifocal” views49 provide a detailed view of a high-interest data region while retaining surrounding \\ncontext to help keep analysts oriented. A second key idea is the use of overview and detail  displays. \\nFor example, a geographic visualization might include a large zoomed-in map (the detail), while a \\nsmaller, zoomed-out map includes a rectangle showing the position of the zoomed-in view within the broader terrain (the overview). In this case, the detail view provides the focus, and the overview provides context. The bene fits are highest when the zoom factor (ratio of overview to detail view) is \\n5-20.\\n42 When larger zoom factors are needed, intermediate overviews may also be helpful. \\nA different approach is to use distortion  or magni fication techniques that transform the entire \\ndisplay region such that contextual regions are demagni fied. A simple example is the Mac OS X \\ndock, which uses 1D fisheye distortion to show common applications; more sophisticated methods \\nemploy distortion in multiple dimensions. While often visually intriguing, complex distortion methods have yet to prove their worth in real-world applications: viewers can become disoriented by nonlinear distortions, which show no signi ficant performance improvement over simpler methods \\nsuch as zooming.\\n39 \\nIn addition to manipulating display space, focus-plus-context methods can be applied directly \\nto the data itself. The goal is to identify which data item s are currently of high interest (focus), \\nwhich are of high importance regardless of the current focus (context), and which can be safely removed from view . DOI  (degree-of-interest ) functions\\n17,24,53 calculate scores for information content \\nbased both on general importance (e.g., top-level categories within a hierarchy , or nodes with high centrality in a graph) and current interest (e.g., as indicated by mouse clicks, search queries, or proximity to other high-interest item s). The distribution of DOI scores can then be used \\nto selectively control the visibility of item s based on the current view size and context of \\ninteraction, as in figure 10. As analysts click on or search for different item s, the DOI scores \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\nDegree-of-interest tree of a taxonomy with 600k item s24 VISUALIZATION\\n12dynamically update to reveal relevant unseen data or hide irrelevant detail. A model of the analyst’s \\ncurrent interest filters the display to the most relevant item s. Low-interest item s are elided but \\nstill accessible through aggregate representations. The interest estimates update as an analyst explores the taxonomy , initiating animated transitions between different views of the data. \\nVisualizations can provide cues to assist analysts’ decisions of where and how to navigate. The \\ncontrols for view manipulation have often been invisible, such as zooming/panning by mouse movement. Improved strategies facilitate discovery by analysts and provide visible indication of settings in legends or other ways, such as scrollbar positions, that provide informative feedback. An important challenge is to show selected items, even when they are not in view . For example, the results of a text search that are not currently in view might be shown by markers in the scrollbar\\n61 or \\nthe periphery of the display .3,19 \\nCOORDINATE Many analysis problems require coordinated multiple views  that enable analysts to see their data from \\ndifferent perspectives. A public policy analyst studying educational attainment might produce a bar chart of people’s ages, a map of locations, a textual list with education history , and a scatter plot showing income vs. education. By selecting a single item or a group in one view , analysts might see related details or highlighted items in the other views. This powerful approach to exploring multivariate data also enables drilling down into subgroups, marking sets, and exporting selections. \\nMultiview displays can facilitate comparison. For example, Edward T ufte\\n52 advocates the use of \\nsmall multiples : a collection of visualizations placed in spatial proximity and typically using the \\nsame measures and scales. As in figure 11, these small multiples, also called trellis plots , enable rapid \\ncomparison of different data dimensions or time slices. The visualization shows employment figures \\nby economic sector in Minnesota. The repetition of the chart form supports comparison among sectors. Plotting all the data in one chart would otherwise clutter and obscure individual trends. Selecting a point in time in one view highlights the corresponding point in all other views. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nSmall multiples displayVISUALIZATION\\n13Alternatively , multiple view displays can use a variety of visualization types— such as histograms, \\nscatter plots, maps, or network diagrams— to show different projections of a multidimensional data \\nset. An analyst constructs a complex patchwork of interlinked tables, plots, and maps in figure 12 \\nto analyze the outcomes of elections in Michigan. Annotations indicate how selected data item s \\ncorrespond between visualization views. Accompanying items  such as legends, histogram sliders, \\nand scrollbars with highlighting markers can all provide multiple views onto the data. Automatically generated legends and axes are important for providing accurate annotations for analysts and meaningful explanations when visualizations are shared. Legends and axes can also become control panels for changing color palettes, marker attributes, variable ranges, or provenance information.\\n43 \\nMultiview displays can also enable interactive exploration across views. Brushing and linking  is the \\nprocess of selecting (brushing) item s in one display to highlight (or hide) corresponding data \\nin the other views.4 In figure 13, a baseball analyst makes selections in one plot and corresponding \\nitems highlight in the others. On the left, selecting high-income players (top-right plot) shows little dependence on career length or fielding ability , but correlates with hitting performance. On the \\nright, selecting the cluster of players who make more assists than put-outs (middle-left plot) reveals a strong dependence on position. Each visualization can thus serve as an input channel for revealing patterns across a data set. Linked selection enables rich, multidimensional reasoning by allowing analysts to assess how patterns in one view project onto the others. Analysts may wish to coordinate views in variety of ways:\\n40,55 selecting item s in one view might highlight matching records in \\nother views, or instead provide filtering criteria to remove information from the other displays. \\nLinked navigation provides an additional form of coordination: scrolling or zooming one view can simultaneously manipulate other views. \\nThough comparing multiple visualizations requires viewers to orchestrate their attention and \\nmentally integrate patterns among views, this process is often more effective than cluttering a single visualization with too many dimensions.

In addition, if designers ensure that \\nrich multiview displays stay understandable, analysts are more likely to make compelling insights. Newcomers to an analysis, or even seasoned analysts simply returning from a coffee break, may become confused by the number of views and the potentially complicated set of coordinated queries between them. Visual analytics systems that provide access to coordination settings and replay the history of view construction can enhance understanding.\\nORGANIZE \\nWhen analysts make use of multiple views they face the corresponding challenge of managing a collection of visualizations. As in traditional window-based interfaces, analysts may wish to open, close, maximize, and lay out different components. As purely manual window manipulation can be tedious, well-designed visual analytics tools simplify the organization of visualization views, legends, and interactive controls. For example, a human resources data set may show a scatter plot of salary by years of experience, plus a bar chart showing 10 age groups, and a treemap with seven corporate sites, each with 10-30 job titles. These three visualizations might give a large area for the scatter plot, with the bar chart and treemap to the right side stacked one above the other. A control panel with sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a search box could be on the far right, with a details-on-demand window and annotation box across the bottom. This tiled approach allows analysts with sufficiently large displays to see all the information and selectors at once, minimizing distracting \\nscrolling or window operations, while enabling them to concentrate on extracting and reporting insights. The coordination across windows means that slider movements or checkbox selections will \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nBrushing and linking of baseball statistics in GGobi VISUALIZATION\\n15cause all views to update, allowing rapid exploration of just the employees at certain sites or speci fic \\njob titles. \\nT ypical systems allow analysts to add views, such as a second scatter plot, in ways that make \\nmodest changes to the existing window organization. An alternative approach is to add a new tab \\nthat contains the second scatter plot, so analysts can switch between the first and second set of \\nwindows. A common feature is to add trellised views, so multiple visualizations can be created at once— for example, separate bar charts showing age distributions for each of the seven corporate sites. \\nMore advanced systems might aid this process through automated support\\n8 that enables multiple \\nwindows to be opened/closed as a group and lays them out in orderly ways. Useful methods include standard scatter plot matrices (showing all pairs of scatter plots) or custom generation of related views of interest (e.g., of data variables correlated to the visualized attributes). Desirable features are automatic (re)sizing as views are added or removed and layout routines to place related views in spatial proximity . \\nAs larger and multiple displays become more common, layout organization tools will become \\ndecisive factors in creating effective user experiences. Similarly , the demand for tablet and smartphone visualizations will promote innovation in layout organizations that are compact and recon figurable by simple gestures. Zooming, panning, flipping, and sequencing strategies will also \\nimprove analyst experiences and facilitate effective presentations to others. \\nPROCESS AND PROVENANCE \\nVisual analytics is not limited to the generation and manipulation of visualizations— it involves a process of iterative data exploration and interpretation. As a result, visual analytics tools that provide facilities for scaffolding the analysis process will be more widely adopted. T ools should preserve analytic provenance by keeping a record  of analyst actions and insights so that the history \\nof work can be reviewed and re fined. T extual logs of activity have bene fits, but visual overviews of \\nactivity can be more compact and comprehensible. If analysts can annotate  patterns, outliers, and \\nviews of interest, they can document their observations, questions, and hypotheses. In a networked environment, analysts should be empowered to share  results and discuss with colleagues, coordinate \\nthe work of multiple groups, or support processes that may take weeks and months. Moreover, analysis tools can explicitly guide  novices through common analysis tasks, provide progress \\nindicators for experts, or lead viewers through an analysis story . \\nRECORD \\nWhen analyzing data with visualizations, users regularly traverse the space of views in an iterative fashion. Exploratory analysis may result in a number of hypotheses, leading to multiple rounds of questions and answers. Analysts can generate unexpected questions that may be investigated immediately or revisited later. After conducting analysis, analysts may need to review , summarize, and communicate their findings, often in the form of reports or presentations. \\nT o support iterative analysis, visual analysis tools can record and visualize analysts’ interaction \\nhistories . At a minimum, applications should provide basic undo and redo support. While low-\\nlevel input such as mouse and keyboard events are easy to capture, histories become much more valuable when they record high-level semantic actions. By modeling the space of user actions (view VISUALIZATION\\n16speci fications, sorting, filtering, zooming, etc.), richer logs can be constructed and visualized.15,25,32,45 \\nCommon visual representations of analytic actions include both chronological (“timeline”) and \\nsequential (“comic strip”) views. As shown in figure 14, a “comic strip” display retraces the steps \\ntaken in a visual analysis of business operations data. \\nVisual histories also reveal the hierarchical patterns of branching histories. Reading the graph \\nshown in figure 15 in a snake-like fashion ( first left-to-right, then right-to-left) reveals patterns of \\niterative exploration, branching, and backtracking in an analysis. T echniques for “chunking” related actions together can further reduce clutter.\\n25,36 \\nVisual histories can support a range of interactions. First, histories provide a convenient \\nmechanism to revisit prior analysis states and resume incomplete explorations. Adding metadata such as comments, tags, or ratings to states can facilitate later review and sharing. Interactive histories can also capture a repeatable sequence of operations that can be named and saved as a \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nVisual analysis history25\\nBehavior graph of branching analysis25VISUALIZATION\\n17reusable macro. This powerful feature enables analysts who are dealing with many similar data sets \\nto automate their efforts. Histories might spur sharing: analysts can export selected analysis trails, ranging from screen shots to interactive presentations, to external media. Finally , histories also provide a means to study analysts and model analytic processes.\\n32,45 \\nANNOTATE Interactive visualizations often serve not only as data exploration  tools, but also as a means for \\nrecording, organizing, and communicating insights gained during exploration. One option is to allow textual annotation of states within a visual history . More expressive annotations are possible through direct interaction with the view , using the selection techniques discussed earlier. Analysts may wish to “point” to speci fic item s or regions within a visualization and associate these \\nannotations with explanatory text or links to other views.\\n26 \\nFreeform graphical annotations  provide one expressive form of pointing.26 Drawing a circle around \\na cluster of items or pointing an arrow at a peak in a graph can direct the attention of viewers. The angle or color of the arrow or shape of the hand-drawn circle may communicate emotional cues or add emphasis. The left side of figure 16 shows annotated occupational data: the top annotation \\nhighlights a gender reversal among bank tellers using color-coded ellipses; the bottom annotation expresses confusion regarding the erratic percentage of religious workers. Although such drawings allow a high degree of expression, they lack an explicit tie to the underlying data. Freeform annotations implemented as vector graphics can persist over geometric transformations such as panning and zooming, but if they are not “ data-aware, ” then they may become meaningless in the \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nAnnotated visualizationsVISUALIZATION\\n18face of operations such as filtering or aggregation. \\nAnnotations can be made data-aware when realized as selections, as seen in the right side of \\nfigure 16.  In the top chart, selection queries anchor annotations of crime data. The bottom chart \\nshows annotations transferred across a change in visual encodings: the selected geographic range \\nis now conveyed using histogram sliders.  These selections can be represented as a set of selected \\nitems, a declarative query , or both.22 Data-aware annotations allow a pointing intention to be \\nreapplied t\\no different views of the same data, enabling reuse of references across different choices of \\nvisual encodings. Data-aware annotations may also enable analysts to search for all commentary or visualizations that reference a particular data item. As data-aware annotations are machine readable, they might also be used to export selected data or aggregated to identify data subsets of high interest. \\nSHARE \\nResearchers in visual analytics often focus on the perceptual and cognitive processes of a single analyst. In practice, real-world analysis is also a social process that may involve multiple interpretations, discussion, and dissemination of results.\\n26,54 The implication is clear: to support \\nthe analysis life cycle fully , visual analytics tools should support social interaction. At minimum, tools must be able to export views (png, jpg, ppt, etc.) or data subsets (csv , json, xls, etc.) for sharing and revisitation. An important capability is to export the settings for the control panels, so other analysts can see the same visualization. Figure 17 shows sense.us\\n26 one e xample of a\\ncollaborative visual analysis tool incorporating view sharing, annotation, and discussion. The system consists of (a) an interactive visualization, (b) a set of graphical annotation tools, (c) bookmark trails for saved views, (d) a text-entry field for adding comments (bookmarks can be dragged onto the \\ntext field to link views to a comment), (e) textual comments attached to the current view , and (f) a \\nshareable URL that is updated automatically as the visualization state changes.\\nA simple but effective aid to collaboration is view sharing via application bookmarking : a visual \\nanalytics system should be able to model and export its internal state.\\n26,54 Unlike a static screen shot, \\nbookmarking enables analysts to take up an exploration where their collaborators left off. View sharing often takes the form of an URL or similar identi fier that allows a collaborator to navigate \\nquickly to a view of interest. Seeing an identical view provides collaborators with a common ground for discussion. Annotation methods can be applied within such views to further collaboration. One challenge for effective view sharing concerns how to handle dynamic data: should a bookmarked view maintain a snapshot to historical data, provide access to the most current data, or both? \\nAnother method of sharing and dissemination is to publish a visualization. Commercial tools \\nsuch as Spot fire and T ableau can publish visualization dashboards as interactive W eb pages. These \\nW eb-based components provide a subset of interactive functionality (e.g., selection, search, and drill-down) to enable some amount of follow-up analysis. Services such as IBM’s Many Eyes\\n54 can be \\nused to embed visualization applets in external W eb sites. Publishing is particularly important for reaching larger audiences. While publishing is a necessary condition for broad sharing, it may not be suf ficient by itself for engaging viewers.\\n21 Visualizations embedded within a blog or \\ndiscussion forum can reach an established audience and may foster discussion more effectively than a centralized site.\\n13 \\nOther collaborative concerns depend on the context of use. Are collaborators working \\nsynchronously  (same time) or asynchronously  (different time)? Are they co-located  (same place) or VISUALIZATION\\n19   F  I  G  U  R  E\\n F  I  G  U  R  E\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F distributed (differen t place)?

Visualizations from The            VISUALIZATION\\n20New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian , and other news sources often lead the viewer \\nstep by step through a linear narrative, guided by supporting text and annotations. In figure 19, for \\nexample, an interactive graphic uses staging and annotation to guide the reader through decades \\nof budget predictions. At a story’s conclusion, such visualizations provide interactive controls for further exploration. These narrative structures both communicate key observations from the data and cleverly provide a tacit tutorial  of the available interactions by animating each component \\nalong with the story . By the time the presentation opens up for freeform exploration, the viewers have already seen demonstrations of the interactive controls. These and other forms of narrative visualization demonstrate how guided analytics can be used to disseminate data-driven stories to a general audience.\\n \\nCONCLUSION \\nW e hope this taxonomy and discussion will help advance visual analytics on multiple fronts. For students and newcomers to the field, the taxonomy provides an orienting, high-level introduction \\nto the interactive concerns at the heart of successful visual analysis. W e encourage interested readers to consult the systems, books, and research papers referenced in this article to develop a deeper understanding of these concerns. For developers, the taxonomy can function as a checklist of \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nSystematic yet flexible analysis in SocialAction41 VISUALIZATION\\n21item s to consider when creating new analysis tools. For researchers, the taxonomy helps highlight \\ncritical areas that would bene fit from further investigation, including new methods for interactive \\nview speci fication, a closer integration of visualization and statistical algorithms, selection and \\nannotation techniques that leverage data semantics, and effective approaches to guided analytics. \\nOf course, by attempting to provide an abstracted picture of a domain, taxonomies may be \\nincomplete. In some cases, we separately categorize aspects that are closely related. Dynamic query \\nwidgets enabling data speci fication often serve as a means of view navigation. Selection techniques \\nare also central to effective annotation schemes. \\nIn other instances, we selectively omit material. First, we do not go into great depth regarding \\nimplementation details. Supporting realtime interactivity often requires careful attention to system design, especially for large data sets. While popular platforms for large data analysis such as MapReduce\\n14 achieve adequate throughput, their high latency and lack of online processing limit fluent \\ninteraction. The demands of truly interactive analysis pose important research challenges for the designers of analysis platforms, ranging from low-latency architectures to intelligent sampling and aggregation methods.\\n34 \\nOur taxonomy is also somewhat sparing in its discussion of the current frontier of visual analytics \\nresearch. For example, how best to incorporate (semi-)automated statistical methods within a visualization environment is a central challenge. Our discussion of derived data only scratches the surface. A related concern is the task of data wrangling :\\n33 reformatting, cleaning, and integrating data \\nsets so that they are amenable to visual analysis. Incorrect or improperly structured data diverts the attention and energy of trained analysts and presents a signi ficant barrier to newcomers. As data \\ncleaning requires nuanced human judgment based on domain knowledge (“is this outlier an error \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  E R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  \\nE R U G I F \\n  E R U G I F \\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n E R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\n \\nE R U G I F\\nE R U G I F\\nData storytelling by The New York TimesVISUALIZATION\\n22or a discovery ?”), data wrangling is a necessarily interactive process combining statistical methods, \\nvisualization, and interaction techniques. This topic deserves a deeper treatment than we can provide within our compact taxonomy . \\nThese concerns represent active areas of research, and we expect our characterization of the field \\nto evolve in the years to come. V alidating and evolving this framework is a community project that can proceed through feedback, critique, and re finement by visual analytics researchers and \\npractitioners.
